# Pandas Descriptive Statistics Project ![CI](https://github.com/nogibjj/ids706-week2-panda/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the application of the Pandas library in Python for descriptive statistics. We use the popular Iris dataset to calculate and visualize statistical summaries.

## Features

- **Data Import**: Supports both CSV and Excel formats.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Computes mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Visualization**: Generates scatter plots for data visualization.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the project files.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
5. Check the output for summary statistics.
6. A scatter plot visualization will be generated and displayed.

## Visualization Preview

Here's a preview of the scatter plot generated using the Iris dataset:
